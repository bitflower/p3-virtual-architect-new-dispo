# PRD: pg_notify CDC for sendung (abn1034)

**Feature ID:** 004_PG_Notify_CDC_Sendung
**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-06-12
**Lifetime:** Temporary — unblocks ABN testing; retained as disabled fallback

---

## 1. Problem

GCP Datastream on abn1034 has proven unreliable, blocking the ABN release testing cycle:

- **Silent stalls:** Datastream stops consuming WAL without logging errors, appearing RUNNING while producing no output (observed 2026-06-08, 2026-06-12).
- **WAL accumulation:** The replication slot `sendung_slot_abn1034` holds ALL WAL across the entire database (700+ tables). During the June 8 stall, this reached 234 GB in hours at ~2.4 GB/hour WAL growth.
- **Disk pressure risk:** An undetected stall can fill the database disk within days.
- **No self-service:** We lack `datastream.streams.update` permission — every incident requires escalation to the Nagel GCP team.
- **Testing blocked:** The ABN test team cannot validate the release pipeline while Datastream is down.

### Root Cause (Architectural)

PostgreSQL's WAL is a single global log for the entire database. Datastream's replication slot must parse 100% of WAL to find the tiny fraction belonging to `sendung`. When the consumer stalls, the slot prevents PostgreSQL from reclaiming ANY WAL — including writes from all 700+ other tables.

Three prior incidents document this same pattern:
- 2026-01-30: 422 GB on uat2820 (replication slot + config change)
- 2026-03-17: Replication slot outage
- 2026-06-08: 234 GB on abn1034 (silent stall, stream reported RUNNING)

---

## 2. Direction Alignment

This feature is explicitly **temporary and scoped to unblocking ABN testing**:

- **Replaces only Datastream** — the transport from TMS DB to GCS bucket
- **The production pipeline stays untouched** — GCS → Cloud Function (`FilterShipmentsTrigger`) → Pub/Sub → Backend (`PubSubMessageHandler`) continues to be exercised. This is intentional: that chain will go live, and bypassing it during testing would leave a major part of the solution unvalidated.
- **pg_notify sidesteps the WAL Sender bottleneck entirely** — the trigger fires only on `sendung` writes; no replication slot is created or needed

## 3. Requirements

### Must Have

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **M1** | PL/pgSQL trigger function on `tms1034.sendung` that fires on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE |
| **M2** | Trigger fires on ALL sendung changes — no filtering at trigger level. The existing Cloud Function `FilterShipmentsTrigger` applies the `sendungsart = 'A'` filter as it does in production. |
| **M3** | Cloud Run writer service with `min-instances: 1` in project `prj-cal-w-wl5-t-6c00-53ad` |
| **M4** | Trigger embeds full row payload via `to_jsonb()` in pg_notify. For INSERT: `to_jsonb(NEW)`. For DELETE: `to_jsonb(OLD)`. For UPDATE: two notifications — UPDATE-DELETE with `to_jsonb(OLD)` then UPDATE-INSERT with `to_jsonb(NEW)`. Writer pairs UPDATE notifications before writing (state machine: hold UPDATE-DELETE until UPDATE-INSERT arrives, write both as consecutive lines in one JSONL file). No database query needed. |
| **M5** | Writer writes Datastream-compatible JSONL to `gs://abn1043-sendung-bucket-1/tms1034_sendung/`. Hardcoded to this single environment for now. See `reference/` folder for example files per change type. |
| **M6** | Cutover: pause Datastream stream `new-dispo-cdc-datastream-sendung-abn1034`, point writer to ABN bucket, verify Cloud Functions process events, drop replication slot `sendung_slot_abn1034` to release WAL retention. |
| **M7** | Exception handler in trigger — CDC failure must NEVER block the original `sendung` write. On error: log warning, return normally, sendung transaction commits. |
| **M8** | Reconnection logic with exponential backoff when AlloyDB LISTEN connection drops. Writer must auto-reconnect and resume listening without manual intervention. |
| **M9** | Cloud Monitoring metric for writer throughput: events received, files written, errors. |

### Should Have

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **S1** | Health check endpoint on Cloud Run for liveness/readiness probes |

### Won't Have (explicit decisions)

| ID | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **W1** | No outbox table | Option B — avoids new TMS table for a temporary solution. Notifications lost during writer downtime are accepted. |
| **W3** | No Pub/Sub retry/DLQ for pg_notify transport | The downstream Pub/Sub chain retains its own retry behavior. pg_notify is fire-and-forget by design. |
| **W4** | No CDCRecovery as guaranteed safety net | Feature is not fully finished. Gap is accepted. |
| **W5** | No multi-environment rollout | abn1034 only. |
| **W6** | No batching | One JSONL file per logical event (1 file for INSERT/DELETE, 1 file with 2 lines for UPDATE pair). Simplifies UPDATE pairing logic. |

---

## 4. Out of Scope

- Modifying the Cloud Function, Pub/Sub topics/subscriptions, or Backend CDC handler chain — these stay untouched and continue to be exercised
- Option A (outbox table) — descoped to avoid new TMS table creation for a temporary solution
- Permanent Datastream replacement architecture — this is a stopgap to unblock testing
- Monitoring for replication slot WAL lag (no replication slot is created by this feature)
- Handler idempotency improvements (known Problem-2 issue, transport-agnostic, separate work)
- Configurable multi-environment support — hardcoded to abn1034 bucket/schema

---

## 5. Security

Low-risk surface: the writer runs inside GCP, connects to AlloyDB via private networking (same VPC as Datastream), writes to an existing GCS bucket. No new external exposure.

| Threat | MVP Mitigation |
|---|---|
| T1: Writer GCS credentials over-scoped | IAM: `roles/storage.objectCreator` on `abn1043-sendung-bucket-1` only |
| T2: AlloyDB credentials in writer config | Use Cloud Run secret manager or Workload Identity for DB auth |
| T3: pg_notify payload contains full row JSON (PII in sendung) | Same data already flows through Datastream to same bucket; no new exposure surface |

### GCS Bucket: Why `abn1043` Not `abn1034`

The active sendung CDC bucket is `gs://abn1043-sendung-bucket-1/`, not `gs://abn1034-sendung-bucket/`. Both exist in `prj-cal-w-wl5-t-6c00-53ad`:

| Bucket | Status | Last data |
|---|---|---|
| `abn1034-sendung-bucket` | Abandoned | 2025 only (last activity Nov 2025) |
| `abn1043-sendung-bucket-1` | **Active** — Datastream writes here, Cloud Function watches here | 2025 + 2026 (through current) |

The `1043` in the bucket name is a typo that was baked into GCP infrastructure when the bucket was recreated (the `-1` suffix suggests a second attempt). The environment is `abn1034`, the schema is `tms1034`, but the live bucket carries the `1043` misnomer. All downstream configuration (Datastream, Cloud Function trigger) points to the `1043` bucket, so the writer must use it too.

Verified via `gcloud storage ls` on 2026-06-12.

### Database Side (AlloyDB abn1034)

| Object | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `tms1034.sendung_cdc_notify_fn()` | PL/pgSQL function | Fires pg_notify with embedded `to_jsonb()` payload. INSERT: 1 notification with NEW. UPDATE: 2 notifications (UPDATE-DELETE with OLD, UPDATE-INSERT with NEW). DELETE: 1 notification with OLD. Exception handler ensures trigger failure never blocks sendung writes. |
| `sendung_cdc_trigger` | AFTER trigger on `tms1034.sendung` FOR EACH ROW | Calls `sendung_cdc_notify_fn()` on INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. No WHERE filter — all sendung changes fire. |

**pg_notify payload size:** Verified on abn1034 (2026-06-12): min 3,782 bytes, avg 4,266 bytes, max 4,636 bytes per `to_jsonb()` call. With JSON wrapper (~40 bytes overhead), worst case ~4,700 bytes — well within pg_notify's 8,000-byte limit with ~3,300 bytes headroom.

**UPDATE pairing guarantee:** Both pg_notify calls (UPDATE-DELETE + UPDATE-INSERT) execute within the same database transaction. PostgreSQL delivers all notifications from a committed transaction together, in order. The writer's state machine holds an UPDATE-DELETE in memory until the UPDATE-INSERT arrives immediately after, then writes both as consecutive lines in one JSONL file — matching the exact format the Cloud Function expects (see `example-update.jsonl`).

### Cloud Run Writer Service

- .NET 8 Worker Service (`BackgroundService`)
- Npgsql `LISTEN` + `WaitAsync` for pg_notify channel `sendung_cdc`
- Stateless notification-to-JSONL transformer — no database read connection needed, only the LISTEN connection
- UPDATE state machine: `idle` → received UPDATE-DELETE → hold in memory → received UPDATE-INSERT → write paired file → `idle`
- One JSONL file per logical event written to GCS
- Reconnection with exponential backoff on connection loss (M8)
- Deploy in `prj-cal-w-wl5-t-6c00-53ad` with `min-instances: 1`

### JSONL Envelope Format

The writer must produce the exact same envelope structure as Datastream. Reference samples from the live ABN bucket are in this folder:

| File | Change Type | Lines | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `example-insert.jsonl` | INSERT | 1 | Single INSERT event, `is_deleted=false` |
| `example-update.jsonl` | UPDATE-DELETE + UPDATE-INSERT | 2 | Paired UPDATE, same `tx_id`, consecutive lines |
| `example-delete.jsonl` | DELETE | 1 | Single DELETE event, `is_deleted=true` |
| `reference-datastream-sample.jsonl` | Multiple UPDATE pairs | 12 | Bulk reference from live Datastream |

Key envelope fields the writer must populate:

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| `uuid` | Generated UUID |
| `read_timestamp` | Current UTC time |
| `source_timestamp` | Trigger execution time (from pg_notify payload or current UTC) |
| `object` | `"tms1034_sendung"` (underscore, not dot — matches Datastream) |
| `read_method` | `"pgnotify"` (distinguishes from Datastream's `"postgresql-cdc"`) |
| `source_metadata.change_type` | `"INSERT"`, `"UPDATE-DELETE"`, `"UPDATE-INSERT"`, or `"DELETE"` |
| `source_metadata.is_deleted` | `true` for DELETE and UPDATE-DELETE, `false` otherwise |
| `source_metadata.table` | `"sendung"` |
| `source_metadata.schema` | `"tms1034"` |
| `payload` | The `to_jsonb()` output — PostgreSQL column names as keys |

### Cutover Sequence

1. Deploy trigger function and trigger on abn1034
2. Deploy Cloud Run writer service
3. Verify JSONL files appear in `gs://abn1043-sendung-bucket-1/tms1034_sendung/`
4. Verify Cloud Function `FilterShipmentsTrigger` processes the files correctly
5. Verify events flow through Pub/Sub to Backend
6. Pause Datastream stream `new-dispo-cdc-datastream-sendung-abn1034`
7. Drop replication slot `sendung_slot_abn1034` to release WAL retention

### Exit / Fallback Retention

When Datastream stabilizes or a permanent CDC solution is decided:

1. `ALTER TABLE tms1034.sendung DISABLE TRIGGER sendung_cdc_trigger;`
2. Scale Cloud Run writer to 0 instances (keep image and service definition)
3. Resume Datastream or activate permanent solution
4. Trigger + Cloud Run image available for re-enable if Datastream fails again

## 8. Verification

| Step | What | Pass Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **V1** | Deploy trigger on abn1034, INSERT a test sendung row | pg_notify fires, visible in a `LISTEN` psql session |
| **V2** | UPDATE a test sendung row | Two pg_notify events fire: UPDATE-DELETE then UPDATE-INSERT, both visible in LISTEN session |
| **V3** | DELETE a test sendung row | pg_notify fires with `to_jsonb(OLD)` payload |
| **V4** | Deploy writer, observe GCS bucket | JSONL files appear in `gs://abn1043-sendung-bucket-1/tms1034_sendung/` |
| **V5** | Compare JSONL envelope with reference samples | Envelope structure matches: `source_metadata.change_type`, `payload.*` column names, `is_deleted` flag. UPDATE events appear as 2-line paired file. |
| **V6** | Cloud Function processes pg_notify-generated files | `FilterShipmentsTrigger` logs show successful processing, Pub/Sub messages published for `sendungsart = 'A'` rows, non-A rows filtered |
| **V7** | Backend receives and processes events | `PubSubMessageHandler` processes INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events. Legs appear, update, and delete in New Dispo. ShipmentUpdatedEventHandler receives both OldRecord and NewRecord for UPDATEs. |
| **V8** | Pause Datastream, drop replication slot | WAL retention released, no slot growth, pg_notify continues independently |
| **V9** | ABN test team resumes testing | End-to-end sendung flow works without Datastream |
| **V10** | Writer reconnects after connection loss | Kill LISTEN connection; writer reconnects with backoff and resumes processing |
